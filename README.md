# React Native Taxi App

This is a React Native Taxi App tutorial. In this tutorial, we will build a Taxi App for both iOS & Android using React Native CLI. Also, weâ€™re going to dive into Unit Testing our entire app using Jest + React Testing Library. We will use AWS with Amplify for authentication, database, and AppSync for GraphQL API for the back-end.
